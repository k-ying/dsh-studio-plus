 * One control height for the whole app.
 *
 * 30px is what a desktop toolbar button measures; the 44px full-width gradient
 * bar this replaced measures like a web call-to-action, which is a different
 * kind of software making a different kind of promise.
 *
 * A disabled button stays hit-testable — no `pointer-events: none` — so the
 * pointer still reads `not-allowed` over it and its hint still explains itself.
 * Every reaction is gated on `enabled:` instead, which is what keeps a dead
 * control from lighting up when it is hovered.
