/**
 * Whether a newer build of this shell has been published.
 *
 * This is the one request the app makes without being asked, and it is worth
 * being precise about what that costs: a single GET to the release feed, no
 * account, no identifier, nothing sent about the machine. What it buys is the
 * only thing a version number is good for — knowing that the bug you are
 * working around was fixed last week.
 *
 * A notice that cannot be waved away is an advertisement, so the dismissal is
 * per version: say no to 0.3.0 and it stays gone until 0.4.0 exists.
