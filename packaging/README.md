# Packaging

Manifests for the five package managers DSH Studio ships through. Every file here
is generated — including `bucket/dsh-studio.json` at the repository root — so
**edit [`generate.mjs`](generate.mjs), not the output**:

```sh
node packaging/generate.mjs          # newest release
node packaging/generate.mjs v0.4.0   # a particular one
```

The script reads the release from the GitHub API, takes each SHA-256 from the
release's own `SHA256SUMS.txt` when it has one and downloads and hashes the assets
when it does not, and rewrites every manifest below. Five registries want the same
three facts — version, URL, digest — in five different shapes, and a hand-edited
one is how a bucket ends up installing last month's build.

| Channel       | Manifest                                              | State                                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Scoop         | [`bucket/dsh-studio.json`](../bucket/dsh-studio.json) | live from this repository                   |
| winget        | [`winget/`](winget)                                   | generated and CI-validated                  |
| Homebrew Cask | [`homebrew/dsh-studio.rb`](homebrew/dsh-studio.rb)    | generated and CI-validated                  |
| AUR           | [`aur/`](aur)                                         | generated and CI-validated                  |
| Flathub       | [`flathub/`](flathub)                                 | generated and CI-built                      |

## Publishing

Scoop is directly served from this repository. The other manifests are generated
from the published release, validated on their native toolchains, and committed
back to `main`; external registry submission remains an account-maintainer step.
Their maintainers can consume these files without recalculating release URLs or
digests by hand.

**Scoop** needs nothing. A bucket is a repository with a `bucket/` directory, so
this one already is:

```powershell
scoop bucket add dsh https://github.com/Moresyl/dsh-studio
scoop install dsh-studio
```

Scoop has no concept of running an installer, so the manifest drives the NSIS one
itself with `/S /NS /D=$dir`. Those are the flags Tauri's installer template
actually reads: `/S` and `/D` are NSIS built-ins, `/NS` suppresses the shortcuts
Scoop makes for itself. `/D=` must come last and must not be quoted — NSIS takes
the remainder of the command line as the path, which is also why a directory with
a space in it is safe.

**winget** wants a pull request to
[microsoft/winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs) under
`manifests/m/Moresyl/DSHStudio/<version>/`. Check it first — this is the one
channel with a validator that runs locally:

```powershell
winget validate --manifest packaging\winget
```

It packages the NSIS installer rather than the MSI, for two reasons: it is a
megabyte smaller, and it installs per-user, so `winget install` needs no
elevation. The `Moniker` field is what makes the short form resolve:

```powershell
winget install dsh-studio
```

**Homebrew** requires a cask to live in a repository named `homebrew-<something>`,
so this one cannot be tapped from here. Create `Moresyl/homebrew-dsh` with the
cask at `Casks/dsh-studio.rb`, then:

```sh
brew tap moresyl/dsh https://github.com/Moresyl/homebrew-dsh
brew install --cask dsh-studio
brew audit --cask --online dsh-studio   # what the tap's CI will run
```

**AUR** needs a push to `ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/dsh-studio-bin.git` with the
`PKGBUILD` and `.SRCINFO` at the repository root. Regenerate `.SRCINFO` on a
machine with makepkg rather than trusting the transcription here — the AUR reads
that file instead of executing the PKGBUILD, so a stale one shows the wrong
version to everyone:

```sh
makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO
namcap PKGBUILD
makepkg -si   # actually install it once before publishing
```

**Flathub** uses GNOME 49, which supplies the WebKitGTK 4.1 ABI used by Tauri,
and the AppStream metadata includes a real application screenshot. CI builds the
manifest. It deliberately requests `--filesystem=home`, because projects are the
application's input. The remaining product boundary is tool execution: a
Flatpak-installed Harness sees the sandbox's commands, not every compiler and
CLI on the host. Until a reviewed host-tool bridge exists, this channel must not
be advertised as equivalent to the native `.deb`/AppImage and should not be
submitted merely to increase a channel count.

## Mirrors

See [MIRRORS.md](MIRRORS.md). Short version: package managers verify the digest
themselves, which makes them the safest way to install from a slow network.
