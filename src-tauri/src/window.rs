//! The application window and the chrome it wears on each platform.
//!
//! The window is built in Rust rather than declared in `tauri.conf.json` so the
//! platform differences below can be expressed as code. They are not cosmetic
//! preferences: each platform has one arrangement that reads as native, and
//! picking the wrong one is what makes a cross-platform app feel ported.
//!
//! There can be more than one. A second window is not a second application —
//! the supervisor, the profile stack and the shelf of sessions all stay single,
//! and every window is a view onto the same ones. What a window owns is what
//! somebody is doing in it, which is exactly what a person running two tasks
//! through one agent needs a second of.
//!
//! Only the first is what the rest of this codebase means by "the window": it is
//! the one that is put away rather than closed while the harness runs, and the
//! only one whose size and position are written down between runs.
