//! The plugin marketplace: what is installed, and changing it.
//!
//! Plugins are ordinary npm packages that declare a profile patch, and the
//! harness already knows how to add and remove them — `dsh plugin` installs
//! into the profile directory and then reconciles the layer list against what
//! is actually on disk. Reimplementing that reconciliation here would mean
//! owning a copy of someone else's rule, so this module does not: it reads the
//! profile manifest to say what is installed, and it drives the harness's own
//! command to change it.
//!
//! What the shell does add is the part a desktop user cannot reasonably be
//! asked to do themselves. `dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm and gives up if pnpm
//! is not on PATH; a person who installed a desktop app has not agreed to go
//! and install a package manager first. So the shell keeps one under its own
//! data directory and puts it on the PATH of that one child process — not on
//! the user's, and not on any other program's.
